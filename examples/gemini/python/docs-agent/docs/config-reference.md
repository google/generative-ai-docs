# Docs Agent configuration reference

This page provides a list of additional options that can be specified
in the Docs Agent configuration file ([`config.yaml`][config-yaml]).

## Web application options

### app_port

This field sets the port which the Docs Agent web app runs on.

```
app_port: 5001
```

By default, the web app is set to use port 5000.

### app_mode

This field controls the user interface mode of the web app.

The options are:

* `widget`: This mode launches a compact widget-style interface, suitable
  for being embedded within a webpage.

  ```
  app_mode: "widget"
  ```

* `full`: This special mode is designed to be used with Gemini 1.5 models.

  ```
  app_mode: "full"
  ```

When this field is not specified, the web app is set to use the standard mode.

## User feedback options

### feedback_mode

This field sets the type of feedback mechanism available to users for providing
the quality or relevance of responses.

The options are:

* `feedback`: This is the default setting.

  ```
  feedback_mode: "feedback"
  ```

* `rewrite`: This option provides the "Rewrite this response" button to allows
  users to suggest alternative responses.

  ```
  feedback_mode: "rewrite"
  ```

* `like_and_dislike`: This option provides simple "Like" and "Dislike" buttons.

  ```
  feedback_mode: "like_and_dislike"
  ```

## Logging options

### log_level

This field controls the level of detail captured in the logs generated by Docs
Agent.

Setting it to `VERBOSE` provides more comprehensive logging information:

```
log_level: "VERBOSE"
```

This field is set to `NORMAL` by default.

### enable_show_logs

Setting this field to `"True"` allows logs to be displayed on a web browser
(which is accessible at `<APP_URL>/logs`):

```
enable_show_logs: "True"
```

### enable_logs_to_markdown

Setting this field to `"True"` saves the generated answers as Markdown pages
on the host machine:

```
enable_logs_to_markdown: "True"
```

### enable_logs_for_debugging

Setting this field to `"True"` generates detailed logs for debugging purposes:

```
enable_logs_for_debugging: "True"
```

## Database management options

### enable_delete_chunks

Setting this field to `"True"` enables the ability to delete outdated, stale
text chunks from the vector databases:

```
enable_delete_chunks: "True"
```

## Secondary database configuration

Docs Agent allows for the use of a secondary database alongside the primary one
for providing additional context from a different source.

### secondary_db_type

This field specifies the type of secondary database to be used:

```
secondary_db_type: "google_semantic_retrieval"
```

or

```
secondary_db_type: "chroma"
```

When `chroma` is specified, the collection in the `vector_stores/chroma`
directory is used as the secondary database.

### secondary_corpus_name

This field defines the name of the corpus for the secondary database,
for example:

```
secondary_corpus_name: "corpora/my-example-corpus"
```

### mcp_servers

This field defines a list of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that Docs
Agent can use. These servers expose external tools that the language model can
use when responding to prompts through the `agent tools` command.
Each entry in the list defines a connection to one MCP server.

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: "my_custom_tool"  # A unique identifier for this tool server
    connection_type: "stdio"  # Currently 'stdio' or 'sse'
    command: ["npx"] # This can be npx to directly run a MCP server with npx
    args: ["<flag>", "<address>"] # Command to use the server for stdio
    env:
      <ENV_NAME>: '{ "headless": true, "args": [] }' # I.E. PUPPETEER_LAUNCH_OPTIONS: '{ "headless": true, "args": [] }'
    # url: "http://localhost:8080/mcp" # URL for the server (for sse)
  - name: "another_tool"
    connection_type: "sse"
    url: "http://localhost:8080/mcp"
  - name: "git"
    server_type: "stdio"
    command: "uv"
    name: "git"
    args: ["--directory","~/mcp_servers/servers/src/git", "run", "mcp-server-git"] # Your machine needs the checkout
```
