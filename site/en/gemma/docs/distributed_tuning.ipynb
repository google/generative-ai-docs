But Large Language Models, such as Gemma, can be very large in size and some of them may not fit on a sing accelerator for finetuning. In this case there are two general approaches for finetuning them:\n",
        "1. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), which seeks to shrink the effective model size by sacrificing some fidelity. LoRA falls in this category and the [Fine-tune Gemma models in Keras using LoRA](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/lora_tuning) tutorial demonstrates how to finetune the Gemma 2B model `gemma_2b_en` with LoRA using KerasNLP on a single GPU.\n",
        "2. Full parameter finetuning with model parallelism. Model parallelism distributes a single model's weights across multiple devices and enables horizontal scaling. You can find out more about distributed training in this [Keras guide](https://keras.io/guides/distribution/).\n",

Note that LoRA can be turned off in this tutorial for a slower but more accurate full-parameter tuning."

The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like Christopher Walken's good name. I could barely sit through it.\""
